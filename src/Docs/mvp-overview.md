## ðŸš€ MVP Goals

To deliver a polished, responsive MVP that:

- Clearly demonstrates sorting/searching processes
- Visualizes core data structures in action
- Includes real-time code highlighting
- Supports customization (speed, size)
- Provides a clean, modern UI with dark mode

---

## ðŸ§© Core MVP Features

### ðŸ”¹ Main Features
- Two main tabs:  
  - **Algorithms** (Sorting & Searching)  
  - **DS** (Data Structures)
- Animated visualizer canvas
- Optional sidebar with syntax-highlighted code
- Control panel with:
  - Algorithm selector
  - Speed & size sliders
  - Start / Reset buttons

---

### ðŸ”¹ Algorithms Tab
- **Sorting:** Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort
- **Searching:** Linear Search, Binary Search
- Visual feedback for comparisons and swaps
- Custom array input support

---

### ðŸ”¹ DS Tab (Data Structures)
- **Stack** â€” push/pop visualization
- **Queue** â€” enqueue/dequeue
- **Linked List** â€” insert/delete at head/tail/mid
